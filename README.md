# 🛡️ BlockHalo

### Project Description  
**BlockHalo** is a decentralized verification protocol where users submit digital data blocks (like document hashes, IPFS links, or unique IDs), and an admin verifies them. Once verified, each block gains a “halo” — symbolizing trust and authenticity on the blockchain.

### Project Vision  
To create a blockchain-based certification and verification system that ensures transparent and tamper-proof validation of digital assets, records, and certificates.

### Key Features  
- 🧱 **Submit Data Blocks:** Users can add verifiable records with unique hashes.  
- ✅ **Admin Validation:** Only admin can verify and mark blocks as authentic.  
- ⏱ **Timestamped Submissions:** Each block carries its creation time.  
- 📜 **On-Chain Registry:** All data and verification logs are public and immutable.

### Future Scope  
- 🌐 IPFS integration for decentralized data storage.  
- 🪙 Reward model for verified contributors.  
- 🤖 Automated verification via oracles or AI validation.  
- 🖥 User interface for browsing verified data blocks.
